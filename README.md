# Data Structures Implementation

This project implements custom data structures in Java, including a hash table (`MyHashTable`) and a binary search tree (`BST`).

## Features
- **MyHashTable**:
  - Implements a hash table with separate chaining.
  - Supports operations like `put`, `get`, `remove`, `contains`, and `getKey`.
- **BST**:
  - Implements a binary search tree with methods for `put`, `get`, `delete`, and iterator.

## Usage
To run the project:
1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   javac MyHashTable.java MyTestingClass.java HashTableTest.java
